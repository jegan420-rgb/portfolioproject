    <h1>Project 1</h1>
    <p>This page showcases my first Adobe Animate project, titled "Karate Kick."</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I wanted to create a relatively simple and recognizable character animation, and add
some visual flourishes around it. The main action taken in this project is, as the
title suggests, a karate kick. However, I didn’t want to simply make a character perform
a kick and call it a day. I wanted my character to take multiple actions, before and after
the kick itself. The signs seemed like a fun idea, so I went with one to introduce the
project and one more to close it out, each being picked up and rotated, and the words
then rotating out of view as they dropped to the ground again.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to work with an armature
on this particular project, and instead chose to animate frame-by-frame with my own hand-drawn assets.</p>
