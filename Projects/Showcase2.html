    <h1>Project 2: Miskatonic Nature Retreat banner</h1>
    <p>This page showcases one of my earlier Adobe Animate projects, for a fictitious client called the Miskatonic Tourism Board.</p>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>In the early 20th-century horror fiction of H.P. Lovecraft, now largely in the public
domain, he wrote of fictional places like Arkham, Dunwich, and Innsmouth, all located in
a region he called Miskatonic. This place was the backdrop for the cosmic horror tales
he penned in the 1920s and 1930s.</p>
<p>My concept for this project was to envision a banner ad for Miskatonic-region tourism that would be inviting. Designed to seem 
    above board, the ad could attract attention and bring visitors in. 
    (Whether they can ever <em>leave,</em> at least in the stories, is another matter entirely.)</p>
