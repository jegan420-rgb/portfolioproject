    <h1>Project 3: A.J. Cooper photo restoration</h1>
    <p>This page showcases my first proper attempt to digitally restore a badly damaged photograph in Adobe Photoshop.</p>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>I wanted to do a photo restoration for my first Photoshop course project. 
        I found an interesting photo at the Library of Congress (with no restrictions on publication):</p>
<a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/bellcm.15413/">https://www.loc.gov/resource/bellcm.15413/</a>
<em>(Retaining the Library of Congress’s naming convention, the asset name is master-pnp-bellcm-15400-15413a.tif.)</em>

<p>This was a photograph of author, educator, and civil rights activist Anna Julia Cooper (1858-1964). 
    While Mrs. Cooper was born enslaved, she viewed education as a way to lift herself and others out of 
    the mire of how African Americans were treated in the United States in her era.
Anna Cooper pursued higher education (and in doing so, became the fourth African
American woman to earn a PhD), became an educator, an author (penning one of the
first expressions of black feminism) and, in later years, she also became a university president.</p>

<p>The photo was taken between February 1901 and December 1903, by photographer
C.M. Bell. So, Mrs. Cooper would have been between 43 and 45 years of age at the
time. Since the photo was black and white, I had the luxury of not having to worry 
about correcting color (although I did manage black-white levels), and could instead focus 
on removing the numerous imperfections found in the source image. The end result speaks for itself.</p>
