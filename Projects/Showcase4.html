    <h1>Project 4: Feline Monthly magazine cover</h1>
    <p>For the final Photoshop course project, I created a magazine cover for the fictitious Feline Monthly magazine.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>For the third and final project in the Photoshop course, I returned to a subject I wanted to use back 
        in the Animate course, but could never get to work. I wanted to use my dearly-departed cat, Shadow, for this project 
        and made her the cover model for a pet magazine.</p>

    <p>The photo of the subject was taken by me in the late 80s or early 90s. The image I worked from is a flatbed scan of a photo with
        a significant amount of retouching and dust removal needed to complete the project.</p>
